&ensp;&ensp;This class focused on using C# to learn about better ways to design software and test it. There's quite a few files in here, but the big ones are the Final and Term Project.

# Term Project
&ensp;&ensp;This was cooperative assignment where we had to design and implement a project from the ground up. My partner and I chose to do a class registration program. I can't remember exactly what parts each of us did, but we tried to split the work as evenly as possible.

&ensp;&ensp;With that being said, I had quite a bit of trouble getting my partner to actually do any work. I ended up coding the majority of this project alone because my partner, if I ever got a response out of him, was always busy with family stuff or out of town. I've never met someone who has so many family events/out of town duties as this individual, so it made it quite hard to actually get this assignment done in the intended manner. The seldom times I did manage to get work from him, it was frequently half done at best and very broken. 

&ensp;&ensp;I informed the professor of this multiple times, and after not hearing anything from my partner for 3 weeks straight my professor reached out to him and finally I got a response... the behavior didn't change.\

 # Final Project, TODO
&ensp;&ensp;This was actually a pretty cool project. It was a simple TODO list program, that we had to go through the design phases and get it cleared before we could start coding. We made Use Case diagrams, descriptions for them, and had two passes on a Class Diagram. Most of the code is done in Program.cs as per the assignment requirements, but there is a Models folder that holds each of the classes that were used. We had to allow a user to add a todo item, see their list ordered by priority;choice(Priority, Project Tag, Context Tag), see the completed list, update an item and quit.

&ensp;&ensp;This was a lot of fun to get set up. I had always really liked using switch cases in previous classes, and I made good use of one for this menu selection. I actually even advised several classmates to use it over a huge chain of if-elif-else. I was shocked how few people knew about the switch statement before this class considering it was a Junior level class intended to be our last prep for senior sequence.\

# Additional Notes
&ensp;&ensp;There was originally intended to be 10 assignments for this class, but our Professor was adjusting the class as he taught it, so there are actually only active projects in assignment folders 1, 4, 5, and 6. Each folder has a pretty good README.md, so I'm not going to put more info here about them.
