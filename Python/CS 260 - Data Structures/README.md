I think this was one of my favorite classes, Data Structures. It was also the last class we did in Python which made me a little sad. We were told that our whole program was shifting over to Python the year I started at Western, and I was looking forward to getting to know Python at a higher level, but as it stands, I feel like I got a good foundation for it with this being the last class.

My code is mostly available in the file labeled **"My Code Repo file ..."**, but there are some other things such as the **"Code Screen Shots"** and **"Coverage"** files that I felt should be included in this. 

This class was a nice combo of fun and challenging. I feel like I really excelled in this class and got to build upon many skills that would stay with me.
