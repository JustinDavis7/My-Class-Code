    <h1>Information about: Pikachu</h1>
    <p>I'll tell you a little about the electric mouse Pokemon named Pikachu.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pikachu use electric type attacks to beat their opponents.</li>
        <li>They tend to be quite fast, and very dangerous to other Pokemon that are water, or flying types. Against ground, grass, dragon,
            and steel types, their attacks tend to be rather weak.</li>
        <li>At a height of 1'04", and coming in at 13.2 pounds, you wouldn't think of a Pikachu's tackle being dangerous, but thanks to the 
            sparky pads on their cheeks, they can easily zap an underestimating foe causing paralysis. <ul><li>In the case of the original 
                Pokemon show, the foe is not generally the injured party, but instead the trainer Ash who raises the iconic Pikachu of the 
                shows, games, and other Pokemon media.</li></ul></li>
        <li>A Pikachu evolves from a much smaller electric mouse named Pichu when they level up, and have reached a good bond with their 
            trainer. Pikachu can also evolve with the use of a thunder stone, but the resulting Pokemon named Raichu isn't nearly as cute.</li>
    </ul>
