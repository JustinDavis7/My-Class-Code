    <h1>This is a demo file made from chapter 2 to show the various things given as examples in the chapter.</h1>
    <hr>
    <blockquote>This is a block quote, made by putting blockquote into brackets. It will be indented on both sides to show it is a seperate piece from the rest of the words above or below it. The line above is called a Horizontal Rule Element made with hr in <strong>brackets</strong>. The word brackets is bolded because it is inside of an phrase element, known as strong. Page 36 shows a whole bunch of other phrase elements.</blockquote>
    <ol>
    <li>abbr</li>
    <li>b</li>
    <li>cite</li>
    <li>code</li>
    <li>dfn</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These are some of the phrase elements mentioned, and put into an <b>ordered</b> list.<br>The next piece is about a description list</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>Description List</dt>
        <dd>A description list is made with the dl container. The title of the list is marked with dt while this definition is marked dd. This can be as long as you need, and will stand out from the title thanks to the structure of this list.</dd>
    <dt>Special Entity Characters</dt>
        <dd>These are characters such as &lt;, &copy;, or &amp;. They require the and symbol, followed by some text and then finished with a semicolon to mark what they are. <ul><li>quot &quot;</li><li>copy &copy;</li><li>amp &amp;</li><li>nbsp &nbsp;Something's here I promise, it's called nonbreaking space</li><li>rsquo &rsquo;</li><li>mdash &mdash;</li><li>#1234 &#1234;</li><li>lt &lt;</li><li>gt &gt;</li></ul>These are all the phrases you can use to make the various entity characters.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A good piece about navigation elements is on page 49.<br><br><a href="http://webdevbasics.net">Basics of Web Design Textbook Companion --- opens in this tab</a><br><br>This is a link done with the a href container.<br><br><a href="http://webdevbasics.net" target="_blank">Basics of Web Design Textbook Companion --- opens in a new tab by using the target="_blank" element inside of the a element.</a><br><br>If you want to link to another page you made, instead of doing an http link, just do something like <b>a href="contact.html:"</b><br><br>There is another form of link to use with emails. <b>&lt;a href="mailto:strikerwolf13@yahoo.com"&gt;strikerwolf13@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;</b><br><a href="mailto:strikerwolf13@yahoo.com">strikerwolf13@yahoo.com</a><br>Sadly this wants to use microsofts shitty mail, but it works still.</p>
