This class had us following a tutorial from the book: 
### Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3, 5th Edition, Author: Terry Felke-Morris, Publisher: Pearson, Copyright 2020. ISBN: 9780135225486.

We completed the Pacific Trails Resort tutorial in the book to learn more about designing web pages and the proper ways to do various things. This was actually a really useful class to take, and I would have liked if it was a mandatory class for the degree, because it would have added so many tools to our tool box for our senior projects. It is definitely a low level class, and doesn't show too many intricate topics, but it's a great place to start for anyone that has never used HTML before.
