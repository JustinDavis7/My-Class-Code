This class was a strange one, **Programming Languages**.

# Haskel
&ensp;&ensp;We started off with learning how to use **Haskel**, which I quickly learned - along with most of the class - I hated. For the most part, what made this class hard was the instruction on it. The class was rather packed with info and we didn't get much time to focus on actually learning the language in class, so we were really just thrown a weak set of tutorials and told to do the work. I ended the class with an A despite the struggles with Haskel, so I guess that's alright.

# POV Ray
&ensp;&ensp;For our third lab we moved onto learning **POV Ray**. While this was a really cool language/technology to learn and use, again, our instruction was lack luster making it a little difficult to do anything very indepth with it. We were shown some amazing projects online that people had completed with it so I know that you can make some amazing stuff with **POV Ray**, I just don't like using it. 

&ensp;&ensp;We were instructed to physically draw, and then write up the language that we would use to create a specific image and that was probably the hardest thing we had to do in this class. <img src="./Labs/Lab%203/Lab3.png" alt="Lab 3 Image" width="300" height="200"> <img src="./Labs/Lab%203/POV Drawing.png" alt="Lab 3 Image" width="300" height="200">\

&ensp;&ensp;Not knowing what any of the syntax really meant, we all started writing out lines of what seemed like complete and utter jibberish on our papers, trying to replecate a drawing that we wanted to create with the code. It was tedious to have to scroll through the Derivations doc we were given with all of the lines of code to choose from, but it could have been worse. All-in-all, this was an interesting thing to learn, and I respect those that can really leverage it and make cool images.

# C and Lyrics
&ensp;&ensp;This assignment was a little weird. We really didn't code much in the fourth lab. We were given a broken **C** file with the task of fixing the bugs to get it to compile. We had to make a few small changes to it, and then modularize it. Since I already had experience with **C#**, **C++**, and **Python** at this point, it wasn't too hard to edit this file to be more modular. There really wasn't much to be learned here, but it was a good exercise in chopping up messy code so that's good.

# Prolog
&ensp;&ensp;Our final lab for this class involved **Prolog**. We had to create the code to satisfy the family tree of the Simpsons that can be found in the LAB_5_Prolog.pdf. We had to use predicates to create a Prolog knowledge base. Initially, this was a really hard lab to conceptualize. Once I started writing it out however, it became very easy to understand and I ended up satisfying the requirements very fast.
