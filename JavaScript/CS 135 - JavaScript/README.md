This is a very introduction class to JavaScript. This class provided me with some good basic knowledge of JS, and would have been very useful to have taken much earlier in the degree - I took it as a junior to get some experience with JS as an elective class.

There's a total of 5 projects, each of which were fairly simple, but did give me the limited experience I wanted.
